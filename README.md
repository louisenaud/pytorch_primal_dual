# pytorch_primal_dual

This code is an experiment on considering the Primal Dual Algorithm as a Recurrent Neural Network.
Requirements

## Requirements
You can pip install of each of the following packages:

- png: to save images
- pillow: to manipulate images
- matplotlib: to view graphs and images

This code heavily relies on PyTorch with CUDA backends. You can find the installer at:
